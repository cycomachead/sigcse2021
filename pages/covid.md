Last update: July 3, 2020

As you know, the SIGCSE TS 2021 is currently scheduled for March 17-21, 2021, in Toronto, Canada.  In anticipation of potential travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 TS chairs and the SIGCSE Board are considering multiple delivery options for the symposium.

To help inform our decisions, we ask the community to complete a survey collecting your views for participation in the SIGCSE TS 2021 and possible options for offering the symposium.  It can be found at: [http://sigcse2021.org/participationsurvey](http://sigcse2021.org/participationsurvey)

Regardless of how the Technical Symposium is offered next year, we want to ensure that everyone can participate regardless of pandemic-related travel policies.  Therefore, the requirement to present in-person to be included in the proceedings will be relaxed for this year.  More specifics on how this applies to each track will be posted on the symposium website when plans have been finalized.  

Our goal is to make a formal decision before the submission deadline and we will communicate with the SIGCSE community as soon as possible.

As a reminder, the deadlines are:

* Friday, August 21, 2020: Paper Abstracts, Pre-symposium, Affiliated Events 
* Friday, August 28, 2020: Full Papers, Panels, Special Sessions, Workshops 
* Friday, October 23, 2020: ACM SRC, BoFs, Demos, Lightning Talks, Nifty Assignments, Posters

Thanks for your patience!
