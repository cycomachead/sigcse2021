## Author guidelines: Workshops 

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest to the SIGCSE community. A successful workshop should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful to the workshop participants. To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants with resources and experiences participants find valuable.

## Face-to-Face or Virtual
The Technical Symposium Committee is currently evaluating options for hosting the Symposium. At this time, either a face-to-face, virtual, or a hybrid conference is possible. It is also possible the mode decision will be made after reviews are completed; therefore, proposers must be committed to hold the workshop in either mode and proposals must include plans for running workshops in face-to-face, virtual and hybrid modes.
Though the general idea of the Symposium Workshop is the same, there are some differences (and some unknowns) between face-to-face, virtual, and hybrid modes. The following lists highlight known differences. Details appear in the “Full Proposal Content” section.

### Virtual Mode
- Workshops are three hours long 
- A workshop fee (in addition to conference registration) is required for workshop participants
- Enrollment limits (maximum enrollment) can be different for online and face-to-face
- It is unknown what platform will be provided for virtual workshops; therefore it is unknown what features will be available in the virtual workshop space.

### Face-to-Face Mode
- Workshops are three hours long with a 15-minute break that includes refreshments (coordinated with the venue and the other workshops)
- A workshop fee (in addition to conference registration) is required for workshop participants. 
- SIGCSE will provide one night free lodging per accepted workshop (not per presenter) at one of the conference hotels. This will be arranged after the selection of accepted workshops. Please discuss this with your co-presenters and decide who will be using the provided free night of lodging. 
- Enrollment limits (maximum enrollment) can be different for online and face-to-face
- Rooms used for workshops can be configured differently for individual workshops (details below)
- A/V (audio visual) Equipment will be provided to workshop presenters (details below)

### Hybrid Mode
Workshops may have attendees participate in person or remotely. In this case, the workshop organizers and presenters should be prepared to support face-to-face and remote participants. 


## Review Criteria and Process

Submissions are **not** anonymous. Proposals are evaluated for relevance, anticipated interest, and quality. Additionally, the Workshop Chairs will consider the availability of appropriate facilities and the variety of topics with the aim of having a diverse program. Finally, for workshops that have run before, feedback from prior workshops may be taken into account. You may want to review the list of last year’s accepted SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshops prior to submitting a proposal.

The proposal has two parts: the full proposal and the EasyChair submission, both of which are discussed in more detail below. 


## Full Proposal Content

The full proposal is used only for the review process. The proposal length is {{site.data.submissions.workshops.limits}} maximum, including title page and references, and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines.
{% include template-information.html %}

The required content is as follows.

- **Title**: A title for the Workshop.

- **Proposer**: Name, affiliation, email address, and website address of the presenter who will serve as the corresponding author.

- **Other Presenter(s)**: Names and affiliations of any presenters other than the proposer. All presenters must register for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and be present for the workshop session, so be certain that you have their commitments before listing them.

- **Abstract**: (Maximum {{site.data.submissions.workshops.abstract-limits}}) An accurate and publishable description of the workshop. URLs are permitted. Abstracts of accepted workshops can be edited in response to reviews. 

- **Significance and Relevance of the Topic**: Describe (preferably cite evidence) the significance, timeliness, and relevance of the topic. 

- **Expertise of Presenter(s)**: Summarize the qualifications of the presenter(s) as they relate to the proposed topic.

- **Rough Agenda for the Workshop**: Workshops are three hours long. A 15-minute break should be included. Explain how you will budget the time, including time for attendee interaction. The agenda should include details on how participants will be supported in the face-to-face, virtual, and hybrid modes. 

- **Expected Audience**: State the target audience (e.g., high school teachers, those who teach CS1, research proposal authors, etc). Also, estimate the number of likely participants. 

- **Participant Equipment Requirements**: 
  - To fully participate in the workshop (see “Hands-On Labs” below):
	- **Equipment Required**. Participants must have equipment during the workshop in order to achieve the learning outcomes.
    - **Equipment Recommended**. Participants are more likely to fully achieve the learning outcomes if they have equipment during the workshop.
    - **Equipment Optional**. Participants may learn more about the topic if they have equipment during the workshop, but having it is not required to achieve the learning outcomes.
    - **Equipment Not Required**. Having equipment during this workshop is not likely to help participants learn more about the topic.
  - The kind of equipment (hardware and software) participants need (if appropriate) 

- **Advertisement**: The advertisement is used by attendees to select workshops. It must address these five points: 1) For whom is the workshop intended,  2) What participants should know after the workshop,  3) highlights from the proposed schedule,  4) equipment requirements for participants, 5) other important information about workshop for attendees (e.g., registration will be refunded by the workshop presenter/sponsor). The advertisement can use less formal language and/or include details not appropriate for the abstract. 

- **Enrollment Limit**: What is the maximum number of participants that can be accommodated in the face-to-face and virtual modes. If no limit is specified, we will assume a cap of 30 participants for face-to-face, although if interest is strong, we may seek to raise the limit to 40 or more. 

- **Face-to-Face Space Requirement**: State the preferred configuration of the room (e.g., classroom style, round tables to facilitate discussion, clear floor space for robots, etc.).

- **Face-to-Face Audio/Visual Requirements**: State the A/V needs of the presenting team, such as wireless network access, wired access, extra power outlets, microphone, digital projector, overhead projector, flip charts and pens, whiteboards, etc. Standard A/V materials and equipment (to be specified at the time of acceptance notifications) will be available for all workshops. Non-standard A/V items will be provided if there is sufficient enrollment to offset the costs. 

- **Scheduling Constraints**: Workshops are typically scheduled before (Wednesday evening), during (Friday evening), and after (Saturday evening) the daily conference program. Please indicate known scheduling constraints.

- **Other Critical Information**: Include any other notes that will facilitate such assessment.

## Hands-On Lab-Based Workshops

Many SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshops are “hands-on,” that is, participants actively use equipment during the workshop. It is normal for participants to use their own equipment in hands-on workshops. Workshop presenters are responsible for distribution of workshop software to participants prior to the Symposium. 

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium Committee recommends that presenters of hands-on workshops provide a URL pointing to all necessary hardware and/or software and instructions for installation to enrollees. (It is unknown if the SIGCSE Technical Symposium can host the material, but there are myriad cloud services available.) The SIGCSE Technical Symposium will provide presenters with mailing lists containing the emails of current enrollees soon after the close of the early registration window and again after the close of the late registration window. We will also collect the software distribution URLs and make them available to on-site registrants. 

## What gets published and where?

If the proposal is accepted, the presenter name(s) and affiliation(s), the workshop title, and the abstract as entered in EasyChair appear on the SIGCSE Technical Symposium website, in the printed program, and in the proceedings. The advertisement as entered in EasyChair also appears on the website.
