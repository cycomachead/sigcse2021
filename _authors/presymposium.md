## What is a Pre-Symposium Event?

Pre-Symposium Events are an excellent venue for SIGCSE sub-communities to arrange their own event or meeting on the Wednesday before the SIGCSE Technical Symposium gets started. We encourage submission of events that describe existing and emerging subfields and the plan organizers have to build growth in their communities. We also encourage events that help develop new faculty and leaders in Computer Science Education.

## Submitting a Pre-Symposium Event

At this time, we are not ready to make an announcement regarding pre-symposium events due to uncertainty as to whether the Technical Symposium will be in-person, virtual, or hybrid.  Once this decision has been made, we will post more information regarding how a pre-symposium event will be run.

Thank you for your patience.
