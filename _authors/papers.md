## SIGCSE Technical Symposium Paper Types

Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions. Initial submissions must be anonymous. Note that an **abstract submission is required for all papers** and it is due a week before the full paper is due.  

**Paper submissions are expected to be original and polished work.**  While there will be the opportunity to revise work from reviews, those revisions should be minor since there is no "review-revise-review" cycle for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  Additionally, we expect that submissions will include a review of previous, related work.

**Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track. Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not be moved between tracks.**

* **CS Education Research** papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, and results as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; and studies of the many different populations that are engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.

* **Experience Reports and Tools** papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention and its context, and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why. This track accepts experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail so that others could adopt the new innovation.

* **Curricula Initiatives** papers should describe new curricula, programs, and degrees, the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. This track may also include position papers, which are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a CS education topic, substantiated with evidence.

### Selecting a Track
Please select the most appropriate track for your work.  The Program Chairs will not move papers between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  

Authors may find ["What is a SIGCSE Symposium Paper?"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3243073) useful as they consider which track to submit to.  Research papers report on work that addresses one or more research questions where studies are pre-planned. Experience reports are a deeply reflective case study or experience that is of interest to the community; they typically don't have research questions, but instead, provide a reflection on the goal of the experience.  Tools papers that are describing a tool and its use should be submitted to the Experience Reports and Tools track.  A research study on a tool should be submitted to the CS Education Research track.

### Paper Resources
There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as *best papers*, which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  Authors will also likely find the [paper review guidelines](../reviewers/paper-review-guidelines.html) beneficial for identifying how reviewers will assess papers for each track.   We have linked in additional resources that you may find useful as you write your papers, especially computer science education research papers.
