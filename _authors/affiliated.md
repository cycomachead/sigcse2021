## What is a Affiliated Event?

Affiliated Events are an excellent venue for SIGCSE sub-communities or groups to arrange a time to gather and present or discuss topics of interest, typically over a meal or during a reception **during the conference**. We encourage submission of affiliated events that describe existing and emerging subfields, areas and groups of diversity, and bringing together communities of practice.

## Submitting a Affiliated Event

At this time, we are not ready to make an announcement regarding affiliated events due to uncertainty as to whether the Technical Symposium will be in-person, virtual, or hybrid.  Once this decision has been made, we will post more information regarding how an affiliated event will be run.

Thank you for your patience.
