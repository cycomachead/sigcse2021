## Overview

[Posters](/authors/posters) provide an opportunity for an **informal presentation** featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on **work in progress** that has not been fully developed into a paper.

Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.

**New for SIGCSE TS 2021**, poster submissions will be reviewed using the dual-anonymous review process (see below).

## Review Guidelines

Keep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.
